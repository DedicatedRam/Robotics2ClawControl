# Robotics2ClawControl
Due to the equipment malfunctioning this robot only operates on a key press input basis.
To play Rock, Paper, Scissors with the robot please input "m" into the serial monitor input.
The robot can also be controlled using W,S  to go forward or backward, A,D to turn left and right, Q,E to ascend and descend the arm, Z,X to close and open the claw.
Also # can be entered to output the values of the motors.

However due to more hardware limitations the robot arm does not ascend properly, due to the motor on the arm I have been using. So in the video the robot does not look like it works.
